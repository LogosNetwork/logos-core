# What is Nano?
Nano is designed to be a feeless, instant, high throughput cryptocurrency.

We've applied the philosophy of "do one thing and do it well", giving you performance and scalability unmatched by any other platform.

### Key features
* Nano utilizes a novel block-lattice architecture, unlike conventional blockchains used in many other cryptocurrencies.
* The network requires minimal resources, no high-power mining hardware, and can process high transaction throughput.
* Offers feeless, instantaneous transactions, as well as unlimited scalability, making Nano ideal for peer-to-peer transactions.
* As of December 2017, the Nano network has processed over four million transactions with an unpruned ledger size of only 1.7GB.
